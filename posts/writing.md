## Why do I write and what am I writing ?

**Why I write ?**

For others immediately: we usually work collectively, we usually work in different rooms, sometimes in different time zones, at different times or different energy levels within the same. I simply cannot assume that everyone will remember what I said in a meeting, in the open-space or on slack.

My goal when writing for others immediately is to make sure they will read & remember most of it.

For the future me and my future colleagues: I like to keep track of decisions, context, motivations (or absence of those) for the future me and my future colleagues event I don't know them.

**What kinds of docs I usually write ?**

I think the most commons docs I write are formal docs such as [RFCs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request_for_Comments) or project plans. These docs are quite common in software engineering. 
They usally describe how something is going to be implemented: 
- RFCs slightly more technical, they are aimed for other engineers to understand how something is going to be build. My goal for those is to make sure these are **scoped** (focus on one problem at a time), **clear** (other engineers with good knowledge on the domain can understand it without asking clarifying questions), **complete** (they leave no holes). They usually contain text and sometimes include illustrations such as architecture / flow / sequence diagrams or code samples.
- Project plans are aimed to product managers & engineering management. They aim to give a picture of when things will be delivered and what's the current implementation status.

## The executive summary

## Highlight important content with boxes

## Use headings

## Styling, keep it minimal

## Shorten your doc with sub-docs or foldable sections
